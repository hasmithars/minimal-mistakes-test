title: "Hello!"
---

I am a Geospatial Project Scientist, currently based out of Northwest Ohio.
Before moving to Ohio in 2021, I lived in Boston where discovered my passion for environmental remote sensing (in addition to mixed-used neighborhoods and public transit but that is a conversation for another time).

I hope to use this website to document some of my 5 - 9 projects
Most of the endeavours displayed here will involve some confluence of GIS and Remote Sensing,
but sometimes I may sneak in a post about a perfect loaf of crusty sourdough or a soft woven blanket that took months to crochet (even though the YouTube video said it should only take a few hours).
My other hobbies include reading for long hours - particularly fiction and fantasy with a dash of the occasional non-fic - and then yoga, in that order, to shake off the stiffness from reading for long hours.
I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about my work and interests.
