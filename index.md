I am a Geospatial Project Scientist, currently based out of Northwest Ohio. Before moving to Ohio in 2021, I lived in Boston where I discovered my passion for environmental remote sensing (in addition to mixed-used neighborhoods and public transit but that is a conversation for another time).

I hope to use this website to document some of my 5 - 9 projects. Most of the endeavors displayed here will involve some confluence of GIS and Remote Sensing, but sometimes I may sneak in a post about a perfect loaf of crusty sourdough or a soft woven blanket that took months to crochet (even though the YouTube video said it should only take a few hours).

My other hobbies include reading for long hours - particularly fiction and fantasy with a dash of the occasional non-fiction - and then yoga, in that order, to shake off the stiffness from reading for long hours.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about my work and interests. If you like anything on here, please make my day and bring it up when you talk to me! :)
